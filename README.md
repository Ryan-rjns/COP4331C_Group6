## Inital Setup
Optional: Download and use GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/   
It's super convenient, and I definitely find it to be easier than git commands

1. Download Unity Hub if you don't already have it: https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal
2. In Unity Hub, make sure you install and use the Unity Editor Version **2020.3.26f1**
3. Using GitHub Desktop (or git commands), clone this repository onto your computer
4. Install Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and choose the "Unity" and ".NET" workspaces
5. And that's it! Open the folder you just cloned using UnityHub, and you're all set to work on the project.

## Play The Game
Once you've downloaded Unity Hub and cloned this GitHub repository:
1. Open the project using Unity Hub
2. Navigate to "File > Build and Run" (or press Ctrl+B), and the built game should open in its own window

If Build and Run doesn't work:
1. Navigate to "File > Build Settings" and click the "Build" button at the bottom
2. Open the folder that you selected and run "HelicopterSimulator_G6.exe"

## Reminders
* Make sure to commit and push to GitHub whenever you finish working on something
* Always check for bugs and make sure your code is stable before pushing to GitHub
