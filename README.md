## Inital Setup
Optional: Download and use GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/   
It's super convenient, and I definitely find it to be easier than git commands

1. Download Unity Hub if you don't already have it: https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal
2. In Unity Hub, make sure you install and use the Unity Editor Version **2020.3.26f1**
3. Using GitHub Desktop (or git commands), clone this repo onto your computer
4. And that's it! Open the folder you just cloned using UnityHub, and you're all set to work on the project.

## Reminders
* Make sure to commit and push to GitHub whenever you finish working on something
* Always check for bugs and make sure your code is stable before pushing to GitHub
