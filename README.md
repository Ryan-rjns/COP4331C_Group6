(I would reccomend using GItHub Desktop, it's very convenient: https://desktop.github.com/ )

1. Make sure you have Unity Version 2020.3.26f1
(Dowload Unity Hub here: https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal )

2. And that's it, you're all set to work on the project! Make sure to commit and push whenever you finish working.
